## Objective  

You might want to keep your code in a third-party repository that's linked to your {{< vendor/name >}} project.
This means you keep all your workflows where you want and use {{< vendor/name >}} for deploying.

Your {{< vendor/name >}} project becomes a mirror of your code repository elsewhere.
This means you shouldn't push code directly to {{< vendor/name >}}.
Any changes you push directly get overwritten by the integration when changes happen in the third-party repository.
