## Objective  

[YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) is a human-readable format for data serialization across languages.
This means it's a good fit for human-edited configuration files, like those at {{< vendor/name >}}.
You can control nearly all aspects of your project's build and deploy pipeline with YAML files.

Learn what YAML is or, if you're already familiar, what custom tags {{< vendor/name >}} offers.
