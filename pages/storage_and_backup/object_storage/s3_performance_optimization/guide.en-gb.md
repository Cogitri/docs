# Introduction

There are several ways you can use to optimize the performances of your buckets on OVHcloud Object Storage. The following guide will walk you through the different optimization methods.

# Using byte range fetch

OVHcloud Object Storage supports byte range fetch. The idea behind is to fetch an object chunk by chunk, each chunk being defined by a range of bytes. The main benefit is that it allows you to parallelize GET requests to download an object, each GET requesting a specific range of bytes: typical sizes for byte-range requests are 8 MB or 16 MB but you can specify any size.
