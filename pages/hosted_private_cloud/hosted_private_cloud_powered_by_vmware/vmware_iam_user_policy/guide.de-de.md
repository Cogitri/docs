## Objective

**This guide details how to associate an OVHcloud identity (a user) with a global IAM policy**.

## Requirements

- An [OVHcloud account](/pages/account_and_service_management/account_information/ovhcloud-account-creation).
- One or more Hosted Private Cloud products - VMware on OVHcloud linked to this account (Hosted Private Cloud powered by VMware, VMware Service Pack).
- IAM enabled for your Hosted Private Cloud service - VMware on OVHcloud. Follow the steps in the guide [IAM for VMware on OVHcloud - How to enable IAM](/pages/hosted_private_cloud/hosted_private_cloud_powered_by_vmware/vmware_iam_activation).

## Instructions

### How do I associate a user with a global IAM policy?

Log in to your [OVHcloud Control Panel](/links/manager). Click on your name in the top right-hand corner of the OVHcloud Control Panel, then click on your initials to go to the `My account`{.action} section.<br>
Under `My account`{.action}, click `Identity and Access Management (IAM)`{.action} and stay in the `Policies.`{.action} tab.

You will find your policies if you have created some.

Click the `...`{.action} button to the right of the IAM policy concerned, then click `Manage linked identities`{.action}.

Then enter the identity you want. This can include users, a NIC handle, an email address, user groups.

Only IAM Groups (not vSphere IAM Groups) appear automatically, so be sure to copy and paste your choice without errors.

Confirm your choice by clicking `Add`{.action}.
