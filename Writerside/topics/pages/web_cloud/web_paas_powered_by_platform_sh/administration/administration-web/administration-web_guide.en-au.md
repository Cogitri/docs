## Objective  

![Overview of projects in the console](all-projects.png "0.5")

This console offers you ways to manage projects and environments other than the [command line interface (CLI))](development-cli1.).

## Project list

The main console page gives you an overview of all your projects.
You can narrow the list down by searching for specific projects or choosing a specific organization from the menu.

Once you select a project, you can [configure the project settings](configure-project1.).
You can also choose individual environments within the project and [configure each environment](configure-environment1.).

You can also create a new project by clicking **+ Create project**.
