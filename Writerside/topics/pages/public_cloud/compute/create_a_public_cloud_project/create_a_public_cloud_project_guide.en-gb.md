## Objective

Creating a project is the first step in deploying [Public Cloud instances](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-gb/public-cloud/).

**This guide will take you through the steps of creating your first Public Cloud project.**

## Requirements

- Access to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.co.uk/&ovhSubsidiary=GB)

## Instructions

Log in to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.co.uk/&ovhSubsidiary=GB) and go to the `Public Cloud`{.action} section.

Once you have read and understood the terms of the contracts, tick the corresponding box, then click `Discover the Public Cloud universe`{.action}.

- If you do not have a valid payment method in your OVHcloud account yet, the process of creating the Public Cloud project begins. Your project will then be created in [discovery mode](#discovery.).
- If you have already registered a payment method in your OVHcloud account, you will need to name your Public Cloud project first, then select your payment method.

Once the creation process is complete, your new Public Cloud project will be visible in the top left-hand corner of the `Public Cloud`{.action} section of the OVHcloud Control Panel:

You now have access to the entire OVHcloud Public Cloud ecosystem. To discover this new interface, read our guide [Familiarise yourself with the Public Cloud interface ](03-public-cloud-interface-walk-me1.).

> [!primary]
> **Discovery Mode**
>
> If this is your first Public Cloud project and you have not entered a payment method in your account, your Public Cloud project is then restricted to the `discovery mode` of the OVHcloud Control Panel. This means that you can browse and discover Public Cloud products, but you cannot yet create resources such as instances.
>
> To harness the full potential of the Public Cloud and start your first resources, click `Activate project`{.action} on your projectâ€™s homepage.
