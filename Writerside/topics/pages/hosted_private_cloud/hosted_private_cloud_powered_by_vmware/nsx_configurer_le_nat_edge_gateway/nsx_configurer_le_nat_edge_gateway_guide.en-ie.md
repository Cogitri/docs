title: NSX-v Edge NAT configuration
excerpt: Using NAT rules to redirect traffic
updated: 2021-11-26

## Objective

NAT stands for network address translation. Itâ€™s a way to map multiple addresses to a single one.      
There are two types of NAT:

- DNAT stands for Destination NAT. It modifies the destination address and is used for inbound traffic.
- SNAT stands for Souce NAT. It modifies the source address and is used for outbound traffic.

**This guide explains how to create NAT rules.**

## Requirements

- being an administrative contact of your [Hosted Private Cloud infrastructure](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-ie/enterprise/products/hosted-private-cloud/) to receive login credentials
- a user account with access to vSphere as well as the specific rights for NSX (created in the [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.ie/&ovhSubsidiary=ie))
- a deployed [NSX Edge Services Gateway](nsx_deploying_edge_gateway1.)

## Instructions

### Interface access

In the vSphere interface menu, go to the `Networking and Security`{.action} dashboard.

- the protocol and possibly sub-protocol targeted
- the source IP or IP range
- if applicable, the source port
- the original destination IP (typically, your public facing IP)
- if applicable, the original port targeted
- the translated destination IP or IP range
- enable or disable the rule
- enable or disable logs on the rule     

Click `Add`{.action}.
