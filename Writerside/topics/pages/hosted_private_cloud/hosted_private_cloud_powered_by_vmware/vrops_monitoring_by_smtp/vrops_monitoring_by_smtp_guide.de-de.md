## Objective

**This guide shows you how to configure your SMTP server to automate the sending of alerts and reports by email to vROps.**

## Requirements

- A working SMTP server
- STMP flows allowed between  your SMTP server and your vROps instance

## Instructions

### Open the flow

The first step is to open a *flow* on the OVHcloud API to enable vROps to communicate with your SMTP server.

You can check that the flow has been opened using this [endpoint](https://api.ovh.com/console/#/dedicatedCloud/%7BserviceName%7D/vrops/outgoingFlow/%7BoutgoingFlowId%7D~GET).

To do this, use the following API call :

> [!api]
>
> @api {v1} /dedicatedCloud POST /dedicatedCloud/{serviceName}/vrops/outgoingFlow
>

Fill in the API call fields. If the results are not as expected, check your server port openings.

| PARAMETER | DESCRIPTION |
| :-: | :-: |
| serviceName | Domain of the service |
| description | Outgoing flow description (for example, here connect to SMTP) |
| ip | IP address of the remote service, e.g 123.100.200.0 |
| servicePort | Remote service port (25,465,587 or 2525 for SMTP) |

### Configuring vROps alerting

Once the flow has been opened, you need to configure the email alert on your vROps.
To do this, go to the `Configure` section, then the `Alerts`{.action} section.

You can test your configuration using the `Test`{.action} button at the bottom of the page.

Once these operations are complete, you will find the details of your alert configuration in the previous summary.

Finally, check that your alert is working properly by verifying that the emails are being received correctly.
